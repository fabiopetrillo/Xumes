Features
========

This document describes the features of the game.
In this version we are not using the Gherkin language to describe the features. 
We are using a very simple way to describe scenarios using the steps.

You need to write a `.features` in the folder on the top of the tests.
```python
Feature: feature1
    Scenario: step1
    Scenario: step2
Feature: feature2
    Scenario: step3
    Scenario: step4
```
